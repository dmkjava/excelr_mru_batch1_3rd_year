What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements

The syntax of pseudo-classes:
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}

Anchor Pseudo-classes
Links can be displayed in different ways:
==========================================
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:active {
  color: #0000FF;
}
